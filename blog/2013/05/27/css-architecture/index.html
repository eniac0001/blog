	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>对于很多WEB开发者来说，很好的运用CSS意味着你可以使用一个模型（you can take a visual mock-up），并能够很好的复用它。你不使用表（tables），并且尽量少的使用图片。如果你觉得你很强大，你要能够运用最新的技术，例如媒体查询（media queries）、渐变（transitions）、变换（transforms）等。尽管对一个高超的CSS开发者来说，这些都是必须的，但有一方面在判断一个人的能力时没有涉及。</p>

<p>有趣的是，我们在考虑其它语言并不会疏忽这一点。一个Rails开发人员并不会仅仅因为他的代码规范而被认为是一个好的开发者。代码规范只是最基本的要求。当然，我们必须考虑代码规范的问题，除此之外，代码的价值（merit）更应该体现在以下几个方面：是否是可读的？是否容易修改或者扩展？是否与应用的其他模块耦合度比较低？是否是可伸缩的（scale）？</p>

<p>这些问题在判断其他代码的好坏时自然而然的被考虑进去，CSS不应该例外。现在的WEB应用程序比以前复杂不少，因此没有经过深思熟虑的CSS架构将导致应用程序的不完美。是时候在考虑应用程序其它代码的优良的同时考虑CSS代码的好坏。不能再遇到问题时，做“事后诸葛亮”，或者仅仅因为设计者的问题而撤销。</p>

<h3>良好的CSS架构的目标</h3>

<p>在CSS技术社区，最佳实践方案很难得到统一。仅仅从<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2658948">黑客新闻(Hacker News)</a>的评论和一个<a href="http://csslint.net/">CSS Lint</a>新版本发布时<a href="http://2002-2012.mattwilcox.net/archive/entry/id/1054/">开发者的反应中</a>就可以很清楚的看到：很多人对CSS开发者应该做什么、不应该做什么这些基础的事都存在很大的争议。
因此，与其讨论我个人认为最佳的实践，不如从定义我们的目标开始。如果我们在目标上能够达成一致，我们就可以开始讨论CSS中不好的实践方案，不是因为它打破了我们潜意识中的“好的实践”的观念，而是因为它阻碍了我们开发的进度。</p>

<p>我认为好的CSS架构的目标应该与其他任何好的软件开发的目标并没有什么不同。我想使我的CSS代码是可见的、可重用的、可维护的、可伸缩的。</p>

<h6>可见性(PREDICTABLE)</h6>

<p>可见性是指你写的CSS规则是与你的期望是一致的。当你添加或修改一条CSS规则时，它不应该影响你所认为的它不应该影响的网站的其它的部分。对于一个小网站来说，它不怎么重要，但当一个网站涉及到成十上百个页面时，可见性就是必须的了。</p>

<h6>重用性(REUSABLE)</h6>

<p>CSS规则应该是可抽取、可分离的，以至于你可以快速的从已有的代码中新建组件，而不是重新新建样式，并且保证不会出现你已解决的问题。</p>

<h6>可维护(MAINTAINABLE)</h6>

<p>可维护性是指当一个新组件或新的风格需要添加时，或者更新或重新布置你的站点时，不需要也不应该重构你的CSS规则即可完成任务。例如：添加组件X时，不应该只因为添加了组件X，而影响了组件Y。</p>

<h6>伸缩性(SCALABLE)</h6>

<p>当你的网站不断增加规模和复杂度时，通常需要更多的开发人员来进行维护。而伸缩性是指出现此种情况时，一个人或一个稍大点的工程团队就可以轻松的管理。也就是说，你的网站的CSS架构在一个人没有较为系统的学习的情况下就很容易理解。这是因为你是唯一 一位在今天接触此代码的人，你却不能保证你会一直维护此段代码。</p>

<h3>公认的不好的习惯(Common Bad Practices)</h3>

<p>在我们看一些如何构造好的CSS架构的方式之前，我想先看看一些不好的习惯是很有帮助的。这些不好的习惯只有经历多次错误之后才能得到好的解决方式。</p>

<p>以下几个事例都是我实际写过的普通的案例，尽管在技术上是有效的，但每一个都可能会导致错误而令人头疼不已。即使我的期望是这次要来点不一样的，但每一次这些样式总都令我陷入困境中。</p>

<h6>基于父节点修改元素</h6>

<p>在几乎所有的WEB站点上，都有特定的视觉元素以至于能够看起来和其所发生的场景保持一致，除了一个。在处理这个“不合群”的元素时，不管是新人还是熟练运用CSS的人几乎使用同一种方法处理。即使用“其独一无二的父元素”或者“新建一个类或ID”来为这个特别的元素新建样式。例如下面这个例子：</p>

<p>In almost every site on the web there will be a particular visual element that looks exactly the same with each occurrence, except one. And when faced with this one-off situation almost every new CSS developer (and even experienced ones) handles it the same way. You figure out some unique parent for this one particular occurrence (or you create one), and you write a new rule to handle it.</p>

<pre><code>.widget {
    background: yellow;
    border: 1px solid black;
    color: black;
    width: 50%;
}

#sidebar .widget {
    width: 200px;
}

body.homepage .widget {
    background: white;
}
</code></pre>

<p>咋一看，上述代码还行，但是，让我们来上述几个目标来分析一下它。</p>

<p>At first this might seem like fairly harmless code, but let’s examine it based on the goals established above.</p>

<p>首先，例子中的 widget 是不可预测的。当一个开发人员写了几个 widget ，期望它们能够看起来一样，但当使用在 “id为sidebar”(#sidebar) 或者“在主页上使用”时，看起来就不一样了，尽管标记是一样的。</p>

<p>First, the widget in the examle is not predictable. A developer who’s made several of these widgets will expect it to look a certain way, yet when she uses it in the sidebar or on the homepage, it will look different, despite the markup being exactly the same.</p>

<p>它也是不可重用或者不可扩展的。当其在主页上以某种样式显示时，其他页面上又需要做什么呢？新的CSS样式不得不添加。</p>

<p>It’s also not very reusable or scalable. What happens when the way it looks on the homepage is requested on some other page? New rules will have to be added.</p>

<p>最后，它也是不可维护的，因为当这个 widget 需要重新设计的时候，不得不在几个地方修改CSS代码，并且，与上面例子不同的是，与其他相比，新提交的规则几乎都不会显示正确。</p>

<p>Lastly, it’s not easily maintainable because if the widget were to get redesigned, it would have to get updated in several places in the CSS, and unlike the above example, the rules that commit this particular anti-pattern rarely appear right next to each other.</p>

<p>Imagine if this type of coding were done in any other language. You’re essentially making a class definition, and then in another part of the code you’re reaching into that class definition and changing it for a particular use case. This directly violates the open/closed principle of software development:</p>

<blockquote><p>软件实体（例如类、模型、函数等）应该是易扩展的，但应是不能修改的；</p>

<p>Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</p></blockquote>

<p>后面我们将看到如何不依靠父选择器来进行修改组件；</p>

<p>Later in this article we’ll look at how to modify components without relying on parent selectors.</p>

<h6>过于复杂的选择器</h6>

<p>Occasionally an article will make its way around the Internet showcasing the power of CSS selectors and proclaiming that you can style an entire site without using any classes or IDs.</p>

<p>While technically true, the more I develop with CSS, the more I stay away from complex selectors. The more complicated a selector the more coupled it is to the HTML. Relying on HTML tags and combinators keeps your HTML squeaky clean, but it makes your CSS gross and dirty.</p>

<pre><code>#main-nav ul li ul li div { }
#content article h1:first-child { }
#sidebar &gt; div &gt; h3 + p { }
</code></pre>

<p>All of the above examples make logical sense. The first is probably styling a dropdown menu, the second says that the article’s main heading should look different than all other h1 elements, and the last example is likely adding some extra spacing for the first paragraph in the sidebar sections.</p>

<p>If this HTML were never going to change, an argument could be made for its merits, but how realistic is it to assume the HTML will never change? Overly complicated selectors can be impressive and they can rid the HTML of all presentational hooks, but they rarely help us achieve our goals for good CSS architecture.</p>

<p>These examples above are not reusable at all. Since the selector is pointing to a very particular place in the markup, how could another component with a different HTML structure reuse those styles? Taking the first selector (the dropdown) as an example, what if a similar looking dropdown were needed on a different page and it wasn’t inside of the #main-nav element? You’d have to recreate the entire style.</p>

<p>These selectors are also very unpredictable if the HTML needs to change. Imagine that a devloper wanted to change the div in the third example to the HTML5 section tag, the whole rule would break.</p>

<p>Finally, since these selectors only work when the HTML remains constant, they’re by definition not maintainable or scalable.</p>

<p>In large applictaions you have to make trade-offs and compromises. The fragility of complex selectors are rarely worth the price in the name of keeping your HTML “clean”.</p>

<h6>过多的类名(OVERLY GENERIC CLASS NAMES)</h6>

<p>When creating reusable design components, it’s very common to scope (as it were) the component’s sub-elements inside the component’s class name. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="widget"&gt;
    &lt;h3 class="title"&gt;...&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class="contents"&gt;
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
        In condimentum justo et est dapibus sit amet euismod ligula ornare.
        Vivamus elementum accumsan dignissim.
        &lt;button class="action"&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

.widget {}
.widget .title {}
.widget .contents {}
.widget .action {}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that the .title, .contents, and .action sub-element classes can be safely styled without having to worry about those styles spilling over to any other elements styled with the same classes. This is true, but it doesn’t prevent the styling of classes with those same names from spilling into this component.</p>

<p>On a large project it’s very likely that a class name like .title would get used in another context or even by itself. If that happened, the widget’s title would suddenly look very different than intended.</p>

<p>Overly generic class names lead to very unpredictable CSS.</p>

<h6>MAKING A RULE DO TOO MUCH</h6>

<p>Sometimes you make a visual component that needs to be 20 pixels from the top left corner of a section in your site:</p>

<pre><code>.widget {
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
    background-color: red;
    font-size: 1.5em;
    text-transform: uppercase;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then down the road you need to use this exact same component in a different location. The above CSS won’t work because it’s not reusable in different contexts.</p>

<p>The problem is that you’re making this one selector do too much. You’re defining the look and feel as well as the layout and position within the same rule. The look and feel is reusable but the layout and position is not. And since they’re used together, the whole rule is compromised.</p>

<p>While this may seem harmless at first, it often leads to copying and pasting from less CSS-savvy developers. If a new team member wants something to look like a particular component, say an .infobox, they’ll probably start by trying that class. But if that doesn’t work because it positions that new infobox in an undesired way, what are they likely to do? In my experience, most new developers will not break the rule up into its reusable parts. Instead they’ll simply copy and paste the lines of code needed for this particular instance into a new selector, unnecessarily duplicating code.</p>

<h3>The Cause</h3>

<p>All of the above bad practices share one similarity, they place far too much of the styling burden on the CSS.</p>

<p>That may seem like strange statement. After all, it is a stylesheet; shouldn’t it bear most (if not all) of the styling burden? Isn’t that what we want?</p>

<p>The simple answer to this question is “yes”, but, as usual, things aren’t always so simple. Separating content from presentation is a good thing, but just because your CSS is separate from your HTML doesn’t mean your content is separate from your presentation. Put another way, striping all presentational code from your HTML doesn’t fulfill the goal if your CSS requires an intimate knowledge of your HTML structure in order to work.</p>

<p>Furthermore, HTML is rarely just content; it’s almost always structure too. And often that structure consists of container elements with no purpose other than to allow the CSS to isolate a certain group of elements. Even without presentational classes, this is still clearly presentation mixed into the HTML. But is it necessarily mixing presentation with content?</p>

<p>I believe, given the current state of HTML and CSS, it’s necessary and often wise to have the HTML and CSS work together as a presentational layer. The content layer can still be abstracted away via templates and partials.</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>If your HTML and your CSS are going to work together to form the presentation layer of a web application, they need to do so in a way that promotes all of the principles of good CSS architecture.</p>

<p>The best approach that I’ve found is for the CSS include as little HTML structure as possible. The CSS should define how a set of visual elements look and (in order to minimize coupling with the HTML) those elements should look as they’re defined regardless of where they appear in the HTML. If a certain component needs to look different in a different scenario, it should be called something different and it’s the HTML’s responsibility to call it that.</p>

<p>As an example, the CSS might define a button component via the .button class. If the HTML wants a particular element to look like a button, it should use that class. If there’s a situation were the button needs to look different (perhaps larger and full-width), then the CSS needs to define that look as well with a new class, and the HTML can include that new class to employ the new look.</p>

<p>The CSS defines what your components look like, and the HTML assigns those looks to the elements on the page. The less the CSS needs to know about the HTML structure the better.</p>

<p>A huge benefit of declaring exactly what you want in the HTML is it allows other developers to look at the markup and know exactly what the element is supposed to look like. The intent is obvious. Without this practice it’s impossible to tell if the look of an element is intentional or accidental, and this leads to confusion on the team.</p>

<p>A common objection to putting a lot of classes in the markup is the extra effort required to do so. A single CSS rule could target a thousand instances of a particular component. Is it really worth writing that classes a thousand times just to have it explicitly declared in the markup?</p>

<p>While this concern is clearly valid, it can be misleading. The implication is that either you use a parent selector in the CSS or you write that HTML class 1000 times by hand, but there are obviously other alternatives. View level abstractions in Rails or other frameworks can go a long way toward keeping the visual look explicitly declared in the HTML without having to write the same class over and over again.</p>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>

<p>After making the above mistakes over and over again, and paying the consequences later on down the road, I’ve come up with the following bits of advice. While by no means comprehensive, my experience has shown that sticking to these principles will help you better achieve the goals of good CSS architecture.</p>

<h6>BE INTENTIONAL</h6>

<p>The best way to make sure your selectors don’t style unwanted elements is to not give them the opportunity. A selector like #main-nav ul li ul li div could very easily end up applying to unwanted elements as your markup changes down the road. A style like .subnav, on the other hand, will have absolutely no chance of accidentally applying to an unwanted element. Applying classes directly to the elements you want to style is the best way to keep your CSS predictable.</p>

<pre><code>/* Grenade */
#main-nav ul li ul { }

/* Sniper Rifle */
.subnav { }
</code></pre>

<p>Given the two examples above, think of the first one like a grenade and the second like a sniper rifle. The grenade might work just fine today, but you never know when an innocent civilian could move inside the blast radius.</p>

<h6>SEPARATE YOUR CONCERNS</h6>

<p>I’ve already mentioned that a well organized component layer can help loosen the coupling of HTML structure in the CSS. In addition to that, your CSS components themselves should be modular. Components should know how to style themselves and do that job well, but they should not be responsible for their layout or positioning nor should they make too many assumptions about how they’ll be spaced in relation to surrounding elements.</p>

<p>In general, components should define how they look, but not their layout or position. Be careful when you see properties like background, color, and font in the same rule as position, width, height, and margin.</p>

<p>Layout and position should be handled by either a separate layout class or a separate container element. (Remember that to effectively separate content from presentation it’s often essential to separate content from its container.)</p>

<h6>NAMESPACE YOUR CLASSES</h6>

<p>We already examined why parent selectors aren’t 100% effective at encapsulation and preventing style cross-contamination. A much better approach is applying namespaces to the classes themselves. If an element is a member of a visual component, every one of its sub-element classes should use the component’s base class name as a namespace.</p>

<pre><code>/* High risk of style cross-contamination */
.widget { }
.widget .title { }

/* Low risk of style cross-contamination */
.widget { }
.widget-title { }
</code></pre>

<p>Namespacing your classes keeps your components self-contained and modular. It minimizes the likelihood that an existing class will conflict, and it lowers the specificity required to style child elements.</p>

<h6>EXTEND COMPONENTS WITH MODIFIER CLASSES</h6>

<p>When an existing component needs to look slightly different in a certain context, create a modifier class to extend it.</p>

<pre><code>/* Bad */
.widget { }
#sidebar .widget { }

/* Good */
.widget { }
.widget-sidebar { }
</code></pre>

<p>We’ve already seen the downsides of modifying components based on one of their parent elements, but to reiterate: A modifier class can be used anywhere. Location based overrides can only be used in a specific location. Modifier classes can also be reused as many times as you need. Lastly, modifier classes express the intention of the developer very clearly right in the HTML. Location based classes, on the other hand, are completely invisible to a developer only looking at the HTML, greatly increasing the probability that it will be overlooked.</p>

<h6>ORGANIZE YOUR CSS INTO A LOGICAL STRUCTURE</h6>

<p><a href="http://snook.ca/">Jonathan Snook</a>, in his excellent book <a href="http://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a>, argues for organizing your CSS rules into four separate categories: base, layout, modules, and state. Base consists of reset rules and element defaults. Layout is for positioning of site-wide elements as well as generic layout helpers like grid systems. Modules are reusable visual elements, and state refers to styling that can be toggled on or off via JavaScript.</p>

<p>In the SMACSS system, modules (which are equivalent to what I call components) comprise the vast majority of all the CSS rules, so I often find it necessary to break them down even further into abstract templates.</p>

<p>Components are standalone visual elements. Templates, on the other hand, are building blocks. Templates don’t stand on their own and rarely describe look and feel. Instead, they’re single, repeatable patterns that can be put together to form a component.</p>

<p>To provide a concrete example, a component might be a modal dialog box. The modal might have the site’s signature background gradient in the header, it might have a drop shadow around it, it might have a close button in the top right corner, and it might be positioned fixed and centered vertically and horizontally. Each of these four patterns might be used again and again all over the site, so you wouldn’t want to have to recode those patterns each time. As such they’re all templates, and together they comprise the modal component.</p>

<p>I typically don’t use template classes in the HTML unless I have a good reason. Instead I use a preprocessor to include the template styles in the component definition. I’ll discuss this and my rational for doing so in more detail later.</p>

<h6>USE CLASSES FOR STYLING AND STYLING ONLY</h6>

<p>Anyone who has worked on a large project has come across an HTML element with a class whose purpose was completely unknown. You want to remove it, but you’re hesitant because it may have some purpose that you’re not aware of. As this happens again and again, over time, your HTML become filled with classes that serve no purpose just because team members are afraid to delete them.</p>

<p>The problem is that classes are generally given too many responsibilities in front-end web development. They style HTML elements, they act as JavaScript hooks, they’re added to the HTML for feature detections, they’re used in automated tests, etc.</p>

<p>This is a problem. When classes are used by too many parts of the application, it becomes very scary to remove them from your HTML.</p>

<p>However, with an established convention, this problem can be completely avoided. When you see a class in the HTML, you should be able to tell instantly what its purpose is. My recommendation is to give all non-styled classes a prefix. I use .js- for JavaScript and I use .supports- for Modernizr classes. All classes without a prefix are for styling and styling only.</p>

<p>This makes finding unused classes and removing them from the HTML as easy as searching the stylesheets directory. You can even automate this process in JavaScript by cross referencing the classes in the HTML with the classes in the document.styleSheets object. Classes that aren’t in document.styleSheets can be safely removed.</p>

<p>In general, just as it’s a best practice to separate your content from your presentation, it’s also important to separate your presentation from your functionality. Using styled classes as JavaScript hooks deeply couples your CSS and JavaScript in a way that can make it hard or impossible to update the look of certain elements without breaking functionality.</p>

<h6>NAME YOUR CLASSES WITH A LOGICAL STRUCTURE</h6>

<p>These days most people write CSS with hyphens as word separators. But hyphens alone are usually not enough to distinguish between different types of classes.</p>

<p><a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/">Nicolas Gallagher</a> recently wrote about <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/">his solution to this problem</a> which I have also adopted (with slight changes) with great success. To illustrate the need for a naming convention consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>/* A component */
.button-group { }

/* A component modifier (modifying .button) */
.button-primary { }

/* A component sub-object (lives within .button) */
.button-icon { }

/* Is this a component class or a layout class? */
.header { }
</code></pre>

<p>From looking at the above classes, it’s impossible to tell what type of rule they apply to. This not only increases confusion during development, but it also makes it harder to test your CSS and HTML in an automated way. A structured naming convention allows you to look at a class name and know exactly what its relationship is to other classes and where it should appear in the HTML — making naming easier and testing possible where it previously was not.</p>

<pre><code>/* Templates Rules (using Sass placeholders) */
%template-name
%template-name--modifier-name
%template-name__sub-object
%template-name__sub-object--modifier-name

/* Component Rules */
.component-name
.component-name--modifier-name
.component-name__sub-object
.component-name__sub-object--modifier-name

/* Layout Rules */
.l-layout-method
.grid

/* State Rules */
.is-state-type

/* Non-styled JavaScript Hooks */
.js-action-name
</code></pre>

<p>The first example redone:</p>

<pre><code>/* A component */
.button-group { }

/* A component modifier (modifying .button) */
.button--primary { }

/* A component sub-object (lives within .button) */
.button__icon { }

/* A layout class */
.l-header { }
</code></pre>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>Maintaining an effective and well-organized CSS architecture can be very difficult, especially on large teams. A few bad rules here and there can snowball into an unmanageable mess. Once your application’s CSS has entered into the realm of specificity wars and !important trumps, it can be next to impossible to recover without starting over. The key is to avoid those problems from the beginning.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are tools that can make controlling your site’s CSS architecture much easier.</p>

<h6>PREPROCESSORS</h6>

<p>These days it’s impossible to talk about CSS tools without mentioning preprocessors, so this article won’t be any different. But before I praise their usefulness, I should offer a few words of caution.</p>

<p>Preprocessors help you write CSS faster, not better. Ultimately it gets turned into plain CSS, and the same rules should apply. If a preprocessor lets you write your CSS faster then it also lets you write bad CSS faster, so it’s important to understand good CSS architecture before thinking a preprocessor will solve your problems.</p>

<p>Many of the so-called “features” of preprocessors can actually be very bad for CSS architecture. The following are some of the “features” I avoid at all costs (and though the general ideas apply to all preprocessor languages, these guidelines apply specifically to Sass).</p>

<ul>
<li>Never nest rules purely for code organization. Only nest when the outputted CSS is what you want.</li>
<li>Never use a mixin if you’re not passing an argument. Mixins without arguments are much better used as templates which can be extended.</li>
<li>Never use @extend on a selector that isn’t a single class. It doesn’t make sense from a design perspective and it bloats the compiled CSS.</li>
<li>Never use @extend for UI components in component modifier rules because you lose the inheritance chain (more on this in a bit).</li>
</ul>


<p>The best parts of preprocessors are functions like <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#extend">@extend</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#placeholder_selectors_">%placeholder</a>. Both allow you to easily manage CSS abstraction without adding bloat to your CSS or a huge list of base classes in your HTML that can be very hard to manage.</p>

<p>@extend should be used with care though because sometime you want those classes in your HTML. For example, when you first learn about @extend it might be tempting to use it with all of your modifier classes like so:</p>

<pre><code>.button {
  /* button styles */
}

/* Bad */
.button--primary {
  @extend .button;
  /* modification styles */
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with doing this is you lose the inheritance chain in the HTML. Now it’s very difficult to select all button instances with JavaScript.</p>

<p>As a general rule, I never extend UI components or anything that I might want to know the type of later. This is what templates are for and another way to help distinguish between templates and components. A template is something you wouldn’t ever need to target in your application logic, and therefore can be safely extended with a preprocessor.</p>

<p>Here’s how it might look using the modal example referenced above:</p>

<pre><code>.modal {
  @extend %dialog;
  @extend %drop-shadow;
  @extend %statically-centered;
  /* other modal styles */
}

.modal__close {
  @extend %dialog__close;
  /* other close button styles */
}

.modal__header {
  @extend %background-gradient;
  /* other modal header styles */
}
</code></pre>

<h6>CSS LINT</h6>

<p><a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/">Nicole Sullivan</a> and <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/">Nicholas Zakas</a> created <a href="http://csslint.net/">CSS Lint</a> as a code quality tool to help developers detect bad practices in their CSS. Their site describes it as such:</p>

<blockquote><p>CSS Lint points out problems with your CSS code. It does basic syntax checking as well as applying a set of rules to the code that look for problematic patterns or signs of inefficiency. The [rules] are all pluggable, so you can easily write your own or omit ones you don’t want.</p></blockquote>

<p>While the general ruleset may not be perfect for most projects, the best feature of CSS Lint is its ability to be customized exactly how you want it. This means you can pick and choose the rules you want from their default list as well as write your own.</p>

<p>A tool like CSS Lint is essential for any large team to ensure at least a baseline of consistency and convention compliance. And like I hinted at previously, one of the great reasons for conventions is they allow for tools like CSS Lint to easily identify anything that breaks them.</p>

<p>Based on the conventions I’ve proposed above, it becomes very easy to write rules to detect particular antipatterns. Here are a few suggestions that I use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don’t allow IDs in your selectors.</li>
<li>Don’t use non-semantic type selectors (e.g. DIV, SPAN) in any multi-part rule.</li>
<li>Don’t use more than 2 combinators in a selector.</li>
<li>Don’t allow any class names that begin with “js-”.</li>
<li>Warn if frequently using layout and positioning for non “l-” prefixed rules.</li>
<li>Warn if a class defined by itself is later redefined as a child of something else.</li>
</ul>


<p>These are obviously just suggestions, but they’re intended to get you thinking about how to enforce the standards you want on your projects.</p>

<h6>HTML INSPECTOR</h6>

<p>Earlier I suggested that it would be easy to search your HTML classes and all linked stylesheets and warn if a class was used in the HTML but not defined in any stylesheet. I’m currently developing a tool called the <a href="https://github.com/philipwalton/html-inspector">HTML Inspector</a> to make this process easier.</p>

<p>HTML Inspector traverses your HTML and (much like CSS Lint) allows you to write your own rules that throw errors and warnings when some convention is being broken. I currently use the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Warn if the same ID is used more than once on a page.</li>
<li>Don’t use any classes that aren’t mentioned in any stylesheet or pass a whitelist (like “js-” prefixed classes).</li>
<li>Modifer classes shouldn’t be used without their base class.</li>
<li>Sub-object classes shouldn’t be used when no ancestor contains the base class.</li>
<li>Plain old DIV or SPAN elements, without classes attached, should not be used in the HTML.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>CSS isn’t just visual design. Don’t throw out programming best practices just because you’re writing CSS. Concepts like OOP, DRY, the open/closed principle, separation of concerns, etc. still apply to CSS.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that whatever you do to organize your code, make sure you judge your methods by whether or not they actually help make your development easier and more maintainable in the long term.</p>
